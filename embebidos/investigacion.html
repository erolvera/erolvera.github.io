The IEEE 802.11 standard has become a de facto used standard for WLANs.  The first version of the standard provides only best effort service for all data sent, without differentiating QoS requirements by type of traffic. The IEEE 802.11e standard is an amendment that improves the quality of service in WLANs existing. The IEEE 802.11e  standard is designed to provide QoS based on the requirements of each type of application. It provides differentiation of prioritized traffic on the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mode, while in the hybrid coordinated channel access (HCCA) mode it guarantees service for applications with strict QoS requirements.<br/><br/>

However, the strategy adopted for IEEE 802.11 requires that the communication among the stations or to the outside of the network be coordinated for a centralized access point, this is especially critical in the TXOP allocation by AP between stations, this feature makes the QoS services provided by EDCA or HCCA  in ad-hoc mode not optimal. Additionally, imposes a serious limiting the scalability of the network as well as on the support that the network can provide to a number of new network applications involving multicast transmission mode.<br/><br/>

The overall objective of this work is to analyze the performance of the IEEE 802.11 standard in heterogeneous environments and network interfaces. We will offer a set of mechanisms thereby offering adequate service priorities to different classes of traffic. In this way we want optimize the MAC-level resources, and accordingly, the performance of the network. Our interest is to study IEEE 802.11e in multicast mode and in ad hoc environments, we want to provide efficient control mechanisms  for each service priority.<br/><br/>
